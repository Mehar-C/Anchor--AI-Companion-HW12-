# ✅ Gemini API Key Added!

## What I Did
- ✅ Added your Gemini API key to `Config.swift`
- ✅ Verified the code compiles
- ✅ Integration is ready to use

## 🚀 Test It Now!

1. **Build and run** the app (⌘R in Xcode)
2. **Type a message** in the conversation
3. **See real AI responses** from Google Gemini! ✨

## 🎯 What Works Now

- ✅ **Real AI conversations** powered by Gemini
- ✅ **Adaptive responses** based on stress levels:
  - **Calm**: Supportive, warm, brief
  - **Rising**: More attentive, gentle guidance
  - **Spiking**: Very calm, shorter sentences, immediate techniques
- ✅ **Context-aware** - remembers conversation history
- ✅ **Error handling** - falls back gracefully if API fails

## 📝 How It Works

The app sends your messages to Gemini with:
- Current stress level context
- Recommended coping strategy (if any)
- Conversation history (last 10 messages)
- Adaptive settings (temperature, length based on stress)

## 🔒 Security Note

Your API key is currently in the code file. For production:
- Consider using environment variables
- Or secure keychain storage
- I can help set this up if needed

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Test the app** - conversations should work!
2. **Want voice?** - Get ElevenLabs key next
3. **Want real stress detection?** - Get Presage key

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

- Check Xcode console for error messages
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Verify the API key is correct
- Let me know and I'll help debug!

**Your Gemini integration is ready! Go test it! 🚀**
